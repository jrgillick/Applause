       " u'Thank you.',\n",
       " u'(Applause)',\n",
       " u\"Thank you very much. That was whistling. I'm trying to do this in English. What is a chubby, curly-haired guy from Holland \\u2014 why is he whistling? Well actually, I've been whistling since the age of four, about four. My dad was always whistling around the house, and I just thought that's part of communication in my family. So I whistled along with him. And actually, until I was 34, I always annoyed and irritated people with whistling, because, to be honest, my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior. I whistled alone, I whistled in the classroom, I whistled on bike, I whistled everywhere.\",\n",
       " u\"And I also whistled at a Christmas Eve party with my family-in-law. And they had some, in my opinion, terrible Christmas music. And when I hear music that I don't like, I try to make it better.\",\n",
       " u'(Laughter)',\n",
       " u'So when \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" \\u2014 you know it?',\n",
       " u'(Whistling)',\n",
       " u'But it can also sound like this.',\n",
       " u'(Whistling)',\n",
       " u'But during a Christmas party \\u2014 at dinner, actually \\u2014 it\\'s very annoying. So my sister-in-law asked me a few times, \"Please stop whistling.\" And I just couldn\\'t. And at one point \\u2014 and I had some wine, I have to admit that \\u2014 at one point I said, \"If there was a contest, I would join.\"',\n",
       " u'And two weeks later, I received a text message: \"You\\'re going to America.\"',\n",
       " u'(Laughter)',\n",
       " u\"So, OK, I'm going to America. I would love to, but why? So I immediately called her up, of course. She googled, and she found this World Whistling Championship in America, of course.\",\n",
       " u'(Laughter)',\n",
       " u\"She didn't expect me to go there. And I would have lost my face. I don't know if that's correct English. But the Dutch people here will understand what I mean.\",\n",
       " u'(Laughter)',\n",
       " u'I lost my face.',\n",
       " u'(Applause)',\n",
       " u'And she thought, \"He will never go there.\" But actually, I did. So I went to Louisburg, North Carolina, southeast of the United States, and I entered the world of whistling. And I also entered the World Championship, and I won there, in 2004.',\n",
       " u'(Applause)',\n",
       " u\"That was great fun, of course. And to defend my title \\u2014 like judokas do and sportsmen \\u2014 I thought, well let's go back in 2005 \\u2014 and I won again.\",\n",
       " u'(Laughter)',\n",
       " u\"Then I couldn't participate for a few years. And in 2008, I entered again in Japan, Tokyo, and I won again. So what happened now is I'm standing here in Rotterdam, in the beautiful city, on a big stage, and I'm talking about whistling. And actually, I earn my money whistling, at the moment. So I quit my day job as a nurse.\",\n",
       " u'(Applause)',\n",
       " u'And I try to live my dream \\u2014 well, actually, it was never my dream, but it sounds so good.',\n",
       " u'(Laughter)',\n",
       " u'OK, I\\'m not the only one whistling here. You say, \"Huh, what do you mean?\" Well actually, you are going to whistle along. And then always the same thing happens: people are watching each other and think, \"Oh, my God. Why? Can I go away?\" No, you can\\'t.',\n",
       " u'(Laughter)',\n",
       " u'Actually, it\\'s very simple. The track that I will whistle is called \"F\\xeate de la Belle.\" It\\'s about 80 minutes long.',\n",
       " u'(Laughter)',\n",
       " u\"No, no, no. It's four minutes long. And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling. Yes, so I whistle the tone.\",\n",
